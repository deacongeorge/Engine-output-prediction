# Introduction:
The data consists of 400 vehicles and ten features on different levels on damage to the vehicles.
The target feature to be predicted is the 'Actualoutput' label class of the vehicle.
The Actual output is an indicator of the of the engine output performance of the vehicle.
A machine learning classification model predicted the 'ActualOutput' of damaged vehicles inorder to automate the process of classification of the level of damaged vehicles using various attributes.
     
# Summary of model building
The preprossing of the data was executed in which each column of the dataframe was cleaned to contain the same
data type. 
#Exploratory data analysis with visualisation was done for insight on the data relationship, variation and distribution, The raw data
was transformed to improve the prediction model. Four base supervised machine learning models were created for pediction using selected
data features after scaling. The models were evaluated on a test unseen data. A prediction performance of 85% accuracy in target prediction was achieved.
